Minimalism has been on my radar for a while. At first just as an interesting life philosophy and later as something I actively wanted to try. Most of my minimalism knowledge was from casually watching [Matt D'Avella][matt-davella] and reading a bit here and there. But minimalism was at the top of my list for this think week.

I finished [Goodbye, Things: The New Japanese Minimalism][goodbye-things], read a bunch of posts on [becomingminimalist][becomingminimalist], [zenhabits][zenhabits], [mnmlist][mnmlist], and [Medium][medium-minimalism]. 

I also experienced minimalism in action. At least I believe so. In [Goodbye, Things][goodbye-things], Fumio Sasaki uses travel as an example of the freedom that de-cluttering and minimizing can bring. Re-reading that passage resonates with me in a way that is hard to describe&mdash;it is so spot on: how I pack all sorts of items in fear that I may need them. Yet I feel nervous that I have forgotten something as I walk out the door. And finally, how I realize none of that matters and I will be okay.

> "You set down your bag and step out for a walk around the neighborhood. You feel light on your feet, like you could keep walking forever. You have the freedom to go wherever you want. Time is on your side..." - [Goodbye, Things by Fumio Sasaki][goodbye-things]

## Why I'm Interested

This is my attempt at explaining why minimalism makes sense. For me. I'm certain some of my views will change as I learn more but we all have to start somewhere.

[Minimalism is about intentionality.](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/what-is-minimalism/) Being clear about what matters and then intentionally focusing on that, removing all other distractions. I've spent the last two weeks with minimal distractions. I have not read the news, been on social media, or distracted myself in any of the ways I usually do. And I have loved it. I know very well I will not be able to fully replicate this experience in everyday life. I have bills to pay and fears to tend to. But for just a sliver of the experience I believe it is worth trying.

[With minimalism we can dream big.](https://www.becomingminimalist.com/big-dreams/) Not about a big apartment filled with stuff I don't use. But about the things that really matter to me.

Minimalism can be good for the environment. Climate change is one of the biggest threats facing humanity and spending less on material possessions is likely to be better than a consumer driven mindset. It is most definitely better than the materialistic tendencies I have right now.

Minimalism is about freedom. Freedom from distractions. Freedom from pretending. It is freedom to move. Freedom to do what I want. E.g., I'm not sure I like my current apartment anymore. But right now I'd rather stay than move as the though of moving all my stuff is debilitating. My stuff is weighing me down and taking my energy in a very real way. It is stripping me of the freedom to easily move.

Minimalism acknowledges the cost of each item is nonzero. The items I own take up space. And space isn't free. But more than just money, my stuff also takes up focus, time, self-worth, and energy. One example where this can be observed is cleaning. Cleaning my apartment takes more time the more stuff I have. And so it consumes my time and my energy. But it also drains my focus and self-worth as I don't clean as often as I would like. How many of my items are worth their _actual_ cost?

Another cost is anxiety about the future. The more we have, the more we stand to lose. I recently bought a MTB. I enjoy riding it but the purchase has also introduced a new fear into my life. I now fear losing my MTB. And this fear is very real. I have considered bike insurance now that I have two bikes to lose. And such insurance is just a way to relieve my fear using money. Does this mean that I should get rid of my MTB? It depends. If the positive value outweighs the negative I should keep it. But too often we never consider all the negative aspects of owning more stuff. In fact, we often completely neglect to consider _any_ negative consequences. 

Minimalism believes [the desire for more is manufactured.](https://mnmlist.com/manufacturing-content/) It is not natural, the "truth", or the only way to live and feel. It is something we have built with the structure of our current society. Capitalism and Consumerism are what Yuval Noah Harari calls _imagined orders_ in his book [Sapiens](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/23692271-sapiens). An imagined order is completely made up. A myth we tell ourselves so that we can cooperate and have an effective society. Companies need us to buy more and more. And to get us to do this they tell us that we are not enough. That we need more. But the companies aren't at fault. They are doing what they were put in this world to do&mdash;make money for shareholders. Not consider what is good for the individual. The myth is that this is good for society as a whole. But with the challenges facing our society today this myth sounds less and less appealing.


## How I'm Getting Started

A few weeks ago I removed a couple of drawers from my apartment and went through my clothes once. These two actions yielded good results but I feel like process has been too slow. If I continue like this I may reduce my excess and distractions to a level I'm happy with in a decade or so. 

So here is my plan:

1. I have booked one weekend for myself to focus entirely on de-cluttering. My hope is that this initial shock to the system will show me some of the benefits of minimalism and guide me forward. My biggest concern with this is that I know getting rid of things is difficult. It is a process and will take time. Which is why I'll use step two:
2. I'll use a strategy I've seen referenced several times in several different versions. The basic idea is to make letting go less painful by doing it in stages. When we de-clutter we will inevitably find something in the back of our closet that lights up memories. Suddenly we remember why we bought it. Or we reminisce about old times. I have already experienced this first hand. So to make the process more tolerable we can introduce a state between _owning_ and _not owning_. A timeout where the things can wait until we are ready to part ways. The more extreme version of this strategy is to pack everything up in boxes and slowly take out what I need over the next few weeks. Everything that remains in the boxes is stuff I don't need. A more relaxed version is to use the boxes for "maybe" items. I can then go through my belongings and sort them in three categories: remove, maybe, and keep. In both versions I will come back to the boxes in the future and getting rid of what is still inside should be easier as I now have clear proof that I don't need the items (at least that is the theory).
3. I'm picking up [The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up: The Japanese Art of Decluttering and Organizing by Marie Kond≈ç](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/22318578-the-life-changing-magic-of-tidying-up) from the library when I come home. I've head it has some tips and tricks.

# Curiosity

During my two think weeks I read a lot of stuff that was not directly related to any of the topics I had set out to study. I read about artificial intelligence, [blockchain](http://karpathy.github.io/2021/06/21/blockchain/), [biohacking](http://karpathy.github.io/2020/06/11/biohacking-lite/), [github pages](https://pages.github.com/), [a climbing trip report from Kyrgyzstan](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1o2MOKEik3qubS1Sd4k5aWFf3dejFQHTMjYe-seAg1WI) (related [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UVOGl7wtRz4)), and much more. I also brainstormed a whole bunch of small projects I would love to do.

But then I felt bad. I was using (wasting) my time on topics that were not on the list I set out to explore. And here's something about me: I only function when everything fits into the bigger picture. If I'm working on a project or reading about something, I need to be able to explain myself why. And usually I solve that by putting the activity into a category. If I'm running I'm doing it for my health, fitness, and often to clear my head. If I'm journaling in the morning I'm doing it for personal growth. When I'm going to work I do it for money and fulfillment. 

And now I had all these different categories that did not fit into my bigger picture. I'm not going to write or create videos about blockchain. And I'm not going to develop anything on it either. So why bother? 

Because something inside me wanted to. And that something was _curiosity_.

As I though more about my conflicting feelings I realized what was driving me. I was curious about artificial intelligence and blockchain, even if I knew that I would not use that knowledge for anything specific. But I now had my category. _Curiosity._ I could put smaller topics and projects under this umbrella and it would silence the voice telling me I was wasting my time. My next question: is curiosity worth pursuing?

Turns out the answer is yes. Big yes.

## The Benefits of Curiosity

The series [Why Curiosity Matters](https://hbr.org/2018/09/the-business-case-for-curiosity) explains a lot of the benefits of curiosity. Although it is focused on curiosity in the workplace I found it interesting. When we are curious we are less prone to confirmation bias and stereotyping, we are more creative and more likely to make constructive suggestions. Curiosity reduces group conflict and makes for more open communication where people share and listen.

These are just some of the benefits mentioned in the curiosity series. But as I started thinking about curiosity I quickly realized it was everywhere. 

I have been practicing curiosity for years with the books I read. My topics are all over the place and I never feel guilty picking up a book unrelated to anything I do. In fact I feel good about that. Excited. And I have anecdotal evidence that it is indeed beneficial. Books inspire, motivate, challenge, and inform me (and much more). 

[The Artist's Way](https://www.goodreads.com/book/show/615570.The_Artist_s_Way) describes a method called The Artist Date that creatives can use to help fill up their creative wells. A Date for you and your inner artist. Time set aside to do whatever we want, no strings attached. If this isn't a call for curiosity I don't know what is. Simply set time aside to be curious and soon you will see your creativity improve (and as we have seen, this theory is indeed backed by science). 

I was also reminded of a podcast I recently watched (I guess you watch a podcast if it has video also, or?) that had a short section about curiosity. This view was a much broader appreciation for curiosity. Not just as a simple tool to boost creativity or make office workers more profitable for corporations. Curiosity is more than that. So much so that I feel almost embarrassed to have questioned it. Curiosity is what makes life interesting. Makes it worth living even. There are so many wonders in this world. So many things to be awed by. But to experience any of this we need to be open and prepared to receive it. We need to give ourselves permission to look around and ask _why_. 

TODO: find podcast mentioned here and see if I have the correct interpretation of it


## How to Spark My Curiosity

My issue with curiosity wasn't so much that I wasn't curious. It was that I did not feel good about leaning into this curiosity. I know now better. But knowledge is rarely enough. When I come home to a busy everyday life I will most likely kick curiosity to the curb (again) and not think twice about it.

So here are some things I will focus on:

- Stay curious with the books I read. This is an area where I'm doing well. I read whatever I find interesting and have no issue with that.
- Be curious online. Whenever I find something interesting i often save it to my [Pocket](https://getpocket.com/). That is one piece of the puzzle. But I also need to give myself permission to browser through the Pocket list and read the things I save.
- Be curious at work. Ask questions. Sometimes I'm curious at work but at times I also put my head down and work on what is in front of me. Being focused is good but I also want to stay curious. It will benefit me in the long run.
- Set time aside for simple curiosity. I did this the last two weeks and it was great.

# Create

[seth-godin-practice]: https://www.goodreads.com/en/book/show/53479927-the-practice

Over the last 3 years I have published 87 videos to YouTube. I like that. I love creating these and I can definitely see progress from my first videos to my latest ones. I still have a (very) long way to go but I'm ready to make videos for someone other than myself. At least I'm ready to try.

I have a mantra for my video creation process. _"I want to create something that makes me proud."_ Whenever I'm in despair or feel pulled towards other motives (money, popularity, ego), I come back to this. It has helped me a great deal and motivated me to continue learning and producing even though I know most likely nobody will watch the hours of video I have created.

I have enjoyed creating videos for myself. But creative work is to be shared. I'll never make a change in the world if nobody sees what I create.

Seth Godin's book [The Practice: Shipping Creative Work][seth-godin-practice] is mainly what influenced this new view. In the book, Seth shows that sharing your work is the _generous_ thing to do. At least if the work seeks to make a change. If it is something only you could create. Something that improves the world in some small way. Then share it with generosity.

This means I need to be clear about who my work is for. It is never for everybody. And I need to actively seek out these people, these communities, and ask them to consider my work. To help and to learn from the feedback. If the feedback is crickets that‚Äôs a sign too. 

I know one pitfall (of many) to pay special attention to. I must be careful not to mistake this for popularity. I have been in that pit before. Not that I have been popular. But I have tried and it drained all joy I had creating. I want to create and I want to share. But for the right reasons.

## Moving Forward

I want to share the work I do. And that means finding my audience and creating for them. To do that I need to include a few new steps in my process. For each new video/blog post I will (try to):

- Have a clear idea _who_ it is for
- Have a clear idea _what change_ I seek to make
- Have a clear idea _how_ I will connect with people.

Hopefully this will guide me and help me get feedback so I can learn to create for someone other than just myself. 

> "The path forward is about curiosity, generosity, and connection. These are the three foundations of art." - Seth Godin in [The Practice][seth-godin-practice].

Reading this made me even more excited about curiosity. It means I have addressed the two first foundations. Now the third:

# Relationships and Community

Relationships are cornerstones to a good life. Just see [the longest study on happiness](https://www.ted.com/talks/robert_waldinger_what_makes_a_good_life_lessons_from_the_longest_study_on_happiness) for some scientific evidence. TODO watch ted

I'm an expert at being alone. Two weeks on my own in a foreign country is nothing to me. Alone in the woods a cold, dark winter night? [Love it](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FqveQjPQkN0). But I also cherish being with other people. I just don't need it as often. And it is not how I build up energy. I do that alone. And when I'm recharged I love to spend that energy with friends and family. In short, I'm an introvert.

I have a few close friendships. I truly value these and want to strengthen them. Same goes for my loving family. It is something I often forget or neglect. It is so easy to take for granted. I don't want that. I want to be grateful instead.

One area where I lack more is community. I'm part of a community at work. And I have a few weak ties to other communities. But that is not a lot. I would love to have more communal experiences. A sense of belonging. 

## Moving Forward

I believe strengthening relationships and building new ones is all about one thing: investing. Any bond becomes stronger the more we invest in it. We can invest time, energy,  money, pain, vulnerability, and all sorts of things in our relationships. And they grow as a result. 

Therefore I want to invest in my friendships and family. Some things I want to focus on:

- Reach out and plan things. The first and easiest investment is reaching out and planning something. After that is is almost just showing up and being present. But showing up and being present is harder than it sounds. So this is worth paying attention to.
- Set time, energy, and money aside for it. Relationships are only going to grow if I'm prepared to invest in them. Show up depleted and no growth will happen.
- Schedule it in my calendar. In the past I have not been good at scheduling or planning things. But if I want to balance relationships with all my other goals I need a stronger calendar game. 

I also want to invest in new communities. One place to do so online is [reddit](https://www.reddit.com/). A quick search revealed more than 10+ communities I would love to be part of. Online communities may not provide the full experience that offline communities can offer. But I still believe being part of an online community can be rewarding. And for someone with a bit of social anxiety it is a lot easier to get started.
